# Keywords and search intent are essential
Any content, whether on [redacted] or on any other domain or social media (off-site), should target keywords or keyword phrases from the [[redacted]]https://www.google.com/). This signals search engines that we’re talking about a specific topic. Otherwise, a piece of content is just a journal entry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The most important aspect of writing SEO-focused content is tailoring content to match user search intent, ie. **content should primarily focus on why the user is searching for the targeted keyword:** is the user researching a topic? Are they looking for a specific website? Are they trying to complete an action, such as trading crypto or downloading a piece of software? **Googling the keyword phrase and checking the top results can provide insight into this.**
More info about search intent [here](https://www.google.com/).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, **keywords should be used in an organic way,** spread throughout the content. **They should not be spammed** as this behavior is penalized by Search Engines.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
# Optimize titles and headers
**Article titles are paramount for SEO.** Titles should be catchy and grab attention but it is important they also include the keyword or keyword phrase being targeted.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Headers are prioritized by Search Engines, and their type also affects this prioritization (\<H1\> having more 'weight' than \<H2\> and so on), so **headers are prime real estate for pushing the targeted keyword.** 
Avoid duplicating headers or overtly similar ones on any given piece of content, though.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**A good rule of thumb is to use questions as headers.** For article titles, a "question + statement" format can be used as well. For example, “[What is [redacted]?](https://www.google.com/)” and “[How many [redacted] are there? [redacted] explained](https://www.google.com/)”.

# Consider the first impression
When someone lands on a piece of content, they should get the impression that they landed on the *right* piece of content.

This means not only having a catchy and descriptive title, it also means that **the first paragraph or section of any content should provide the user with a useful summary or quality introduction** that instills **topical authority** and matches user **search intent.**

If an image is used alongside the title, this image should not only be content-related but provide the user with useful context or information. If not, the image is probably not needed.

The purpose of generating a good first impression is two-fold:
First, we want users to go through the content and potentially click on any of the CTAs present throughout.
Second, **we want to avoid "bouncing" as much as possible,** as Search Engines penalize URLs and domains that have a high ratio of users leaving the site too quickly after clicking on a search result.
  

# Content structure
It is important to design content that is as easy to read as possible. **Avoid long paragraphs,** break them up if necessary. **Use bullet points or numbered lists** where possible for better scannability.
  

# URL optimization
Ensure the page URL is short, readable, and includes the targeted keyword if possible. For example: /tealstreet-hyperliquid-trading-integration.
  

# Linking
Whenever possible, **add links to relevant pages within the Tealstreet.io website** to build and grow the site’s internal linking.

Anchor links with descriptive, useful text. For example, “[Explore the [redacted] of [redacted]](https://www.google.com/)” Instead of “[Click here](https://www.google.com/) to read about [redacted]”.

**Optimize Call-To-Actions (CTAs) with keywords and phrasing that highlight a benefit to the user,** for example “[Explore the [redacted]](https://www.google.com/)”. Try not to spam CTAs throughout the content but place them strategically instead: one right below the introduction/TLDR section, one or two peppered throughout if relevant and the article length allows it, and one at the end of the content.
  

# Meta-data
## Page Title tag:
**Use the primary targeted keyword** in the Page Title tag. Do not spam keywords.

Title tag should be descriptive of the content and **it should not go above 50-60 characters in length.** SERPs truncate titles that are too long, and can even rewrite them. You can check the length [here](https://metatags.io/).

**If the \<H1\> header length allows it, use the same copy for the Page Title tag.** If not, ensure they are similar enough to avoid searcher confusion.

When in doubt, **Google the targeted keyword and analyze the titles of the top-ranking results.** Observe how these titles are structured and look for patterns and similarities that we can then incorporate into our own titles. 
This will also provide insights into user search intent.

## Meta description tag:
Even though Search Engines do not use description tags for ranking purposes, they are still very useful as they can appear on SERPs and can be shown when the URL is shared.

To avoid the description being truncated, **try to keep its length below 105 characters** whenever possible, and definitely **do not go higher than 155.**

Make sure to **include the targeted keyword** or keyword phrase.

**Write a description that addresses the user search intent** -the searcher's goal-. In other words, try to give the searcher what they want to see when searching for the targeted keyword.

## Alt Text for images:
Ensure all images in the article **include descriptive alt text with targeted keywords.**
  

# References
When in doubt about formatting or in need of some reference material, [[redacted]](https://www.google.com/) and [[redacted]](https://www.google.com/) are excellent sources of SEO-focused content and structure.
